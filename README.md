# Project Overview
Our project focuses on the Car-196 dataset, which contains images of 196 different car models. The goal of the project is to build deep learning models to classify images of cars into their respective models. We used various deep learning techniques, including image retrieval, transfer learning, and end-to-end CNN, to achieve this goal.

##Technologies Used
We used TensorFlow and Keras as the primary technologies for implementing the deep learning models. We also used other Python libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.

##Notebook Structure
The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. Introduction: Provides an overview of the project and dataset.

2. Data Preparation: Covers the process of downloading and preprocessing the Car-196 dataset.

3. Image Retrieval: Discusses the implementation of an image retrieval model using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

4. Transfer Learning: Covers the implementation of a transfer learning model using some pre-trained models.

5. End-to-End CNN: Discusses the implementation of an end-to-end CNN models.

6. Training and Evaluation: Covers the process of training and evaluating the models on the Car-196 dataset (this section is part of the sections above).

7. Testing Environment: Provides instructions on how to test the models on new images.

##Installation Requirements
Before running the code, the following libraries and packages need to be installed:

1. TensorFlow and Keras
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Scikit-learn

##Training Process
The training process involves the following steps:

1. Data preparation: The dataset is downloaded and preprocessed to create train, validation, and test datasets.
2. Model creation: Three deep learning models, including image retrieval, transfer learning, and end-to-end CNN, are created and compiled.
3. Model training: The models are trained on the train and validation datasets using the appropriate training process for each model.
4. Model evaluation: The models are evaluated on the test dataset, and the performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and loss, are recorded.

##Testing Process
To test the models on new images, follow the instructions provided in the "Test Environment" section of the notebook. The instructions include loading the saved models and using them to classify new images.

Overall, our project aims to demonstrate how deep learning techniques can be used to classify images of cars accurately. We hope that our work inspires others to explore similar problems and contributes to the development of better image classification models.
